## Episode 1 - ARM64 Word Sort
A Command Line application written in ARM64 Assembly language that takes a list of words and outputs the same list in sorted, lexicographical order. In this episode we go over setting up the project, researching where to find information about system calls, how to debug assembly with lldb, and much more.
